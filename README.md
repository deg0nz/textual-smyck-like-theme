# Smyck-like Color Theme for Textual

I wanted a Color Theme for Textual, that matches my terminal-colors, which are based on the Smyck-Color Profile by hukl.
So big credit to him! Visit his pages http://smyck.net and http://color.smyck.org.

The theme is still under development, and some changes will come in the future. It's not yet perfect, but usable.

This theme is based on the textual-solarized-dark theme by Xorcode
(https://github.com/Xorcode/ OR http://www.xorcode.com/)
